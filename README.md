## ✨ Why I Built This

Hi, I'm **Gericho Miranda**, a developer who's walked the long, frustrating road of applying to job after job and hearing nothing back.

After spending countless hours tailoring resumes, reading job descriptions, and second-guessing every word on my CV, I realized I needed help — not just generic advice, but real, actionable insight. So I decided to build **ResuMate**, an AI-powered resume analyzer that compares your resume directly to the job you’re applying for and gives you instant, targeted feedback.

I created this tool first and foremost for *me* — and in doing so, I hope to empower others who’ve shared my experience. Whether you’re a student, a career changer, or someone just trying to get your foot in the door, ResuMate was made with you in mind.

## 🚀 What It Does

ResuMate allows you to:
- 📤 Upload your resume (PDF format)
- 📋 Paste a job description
- 💡 Instantly receive AI-powered suggestions for how to improve your resume to better match the job
- 🔁 Reset and reuse the tool for multiple roles
- 🔒 Keep your OpenAI key safe with environment variables

Behind the scenes, it uses OpenAI’s GPT model to intelligently analyze the content of your resume and compare it to what the job post is asking for — helping you close the gap between what you *have* and what employers *need to see*.
